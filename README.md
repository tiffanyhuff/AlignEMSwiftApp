Description:
-----------------------

This application will allow a user to submit a job on the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) [Lonestar6 Supercomputer](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/lonestar6) to utilize [AlignEM-SWiFT](https://github.com/SynapseWeb/pyReconstruct#pyreconstruct); the Python functionality of the 3D image reconstruction software [RECONSTRUCT](https://synapseweb.clm.utexas.edu/software-0).

Running the Application:
-----------------------
To run the application, the user must submit a job using the [3D Electron Microscopy (3Dem)](https://3dem.org/) web-based research platform. Once running, a virtual DCV session will be initialized for the user, and a button on the History/Jobs page will appear allowing the user to open the session. Additionally, a document titled 'alignem_dcvserver.txt' will be created in the user's work folder with connection instructions. Once connected, the AlignEM-SWiFT software will begin running, and a Tapis jobs archive folder will appear on the desktop for the user's convenience.

For instructions on using AlignEM-SWiFT, please see the [documentation](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/khlab/tSEM+image+alignment+using+AlignEM-SWiFT).
